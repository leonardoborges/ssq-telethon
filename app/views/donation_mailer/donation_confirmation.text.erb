Message from Premier of Queensland

Please accept my personal thanks for your generous donation to the Premierâ€™s Disaster Relief Appeal.

The kindness and generosity of donors such as yourself is greatly appreciated. All of the money raised by the appeal will be used to assist the people who have been affected by the extensive flooding experienced across Queensland communities during December 2010 and early January 2011.

I can assure you that my Government is committed to helping the affected communities on the road to recovery and will continue to work in partnership with the Australian Government, local councils, Australian Red Cross and other non-government organisations and volunteers to support people through this difficult time.

ANNA BLIGH MP

PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND
